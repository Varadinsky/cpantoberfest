# CPANtoberfest

A list of CPAN distributions that you could work on for Hacktoberfest.

To extend the list, add projects to `repo-list.json` then rebuild the HTML with:

    ./build-page repo-list.json > index.html

You don't need to include your generated version of `index.html` in your PR,
just the changes to `repo-list.json`.

Feel free to hack on the CSS for this as well.
